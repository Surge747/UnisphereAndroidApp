# Project Description
### Project Overview

For a university course, I was part of a group project where we were tasked with creating an Android application called UniSphere. UniSphere is a forum application designed specifically for university students from different backgrounds, providing a platform for open and fair communication about courses, studies, and daily life.

### Challenges Faced

Our group of five decided to split tasks. While I worked on the Firebase connectivity and UI as a separate project, two of my teammates focused on building a local database system (DBS). However, we later discovered that local databases were not allowed for the project, which meant we had to scrap their work entirely. Despite this setback, we developed several key features for UniSphere, such as secure login functionality, data handling, and real-time search capabilities.

### Decision-Making and Compromise

The decision to invalidate one of the projects was difficult. To address this, I proposed a compromise: I would integrate the logic of their DBS into my project, effectively merging their efforts with mine. This required me to analyze their code and reimplement it within my own framework. Despite this, I ensured that they received credit for their contributions to the project. Through this process, we were able to include features such as advanced search filtering, secure data deletion, and real-time updates using Firebase.

### Key Features of UniSphere

1. **Login and Authentication (FB-Auth)**: Implemented using Firebase to ensure secure user authentication and session management.
2. **Data Handling and Management (DataFiles)**: Structured and managed essential data files, facilitating seamless integration with Firebase.
3. **Real-time Search and Filtering (Search, Search Filter)**: Developed efficient search capabilities and filtering mechanisms, enabling users to find relevant information quickly.
4. **Profile Management (Data-Profile)**: Implemented user profiles showing courses and images, with the ability to block users and manage privacy settings.
5. **Direct Messaging (P2P-DM)**: Integrated peer-to-peer direct messaging, allowing users to communicate directly within the app.

### Key Takeaways

One significant takeaway from this experience was the realization that combining separate Android applications is far more challenging than starting from scratch. Resolving the errors and integrating different parts of the project proved to be much more time-consuming and complex than initially anticipated. However, the process allowed me to enhance my skills in Firebase integration, UI design, and the implementation of advanced features, such as real-time search and secure authentication.
